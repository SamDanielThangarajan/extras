steps to compilation
  Lexical parser -> Preprocessor -> write assembly -> write assembled object code -> linker

- compiler
   - -E to stop after preprocessor
      -> Note contant replacement
      -> File content sustitution
      -> line by line processing
      -> Format of comments changed
   - -S to stop after writing assembly code
   - -c to stop after writing object code

- linker
   - What are libraries?
      -> Two parts : header and lib
   - static library
   - dynamic library

Activity
- crack a number lock
   - robot
   - elf read
   - LD_PRELOAD

- name mangling (off track but still useful)
