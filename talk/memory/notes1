C++ memory specifications:
   - static :
       Scope begin: program starts
       Scope end: program finishes
   - automatic :
       Scope begin: {
       Scope end: }
   - dynamic :
       Scope begin: new/malloc
       Scope end: delete/free
   - thread_local :
       Similar to static but only limited to a thread
       
- Which is effecient when copying (automatic/dynamic)?
- shared_ptr?
